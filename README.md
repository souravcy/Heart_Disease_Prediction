# Heart_Disease_Prediction
Using Machine Learning to predict Heart Disease Using different Machine Learning Algorithms.
Preventing Heart diseases is more than necessary. Research can be improved using good data-driven systems for predicting the heart diseases and preventing them. Machine Learning can be used to build these data-driven systems.

This is a classification problem, the input features being a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether the patient has heart disease or not.

The project involves: 
1. Analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing.
2. Applying feature engineering to the input variables.
3. Training models with different algorithms and and predicting the output variable.

Machine Learning algorithms used:
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machine (Linear)
K-Nearest Neighbors
Decision Tree 
Random Forest 
XGBoost 

Highest Accuracy achieved: 85% (Random Forest)
